# Mobile-Price-Classification Paper
#1. Introduction
For this project, our group is interested in the “Mobile Price Classification”. A new mobile company is starting it’s business, and this store wants to give tough fights to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc.
The company founder Bob does not know how to estimate the price of mobiles that his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume market prices for phones. To solve this problem Bob collects sales data of mobile phones from various companies.
Bob wants to find out some relations between mobile phones’ features (eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and selling prices. 
About this data set, there are 21 columns with 1000 of observations, the following are the descriptions for each variable: 
ID: The Ids.
Battery_power: Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh
Blue: Has bluetooth or not
Clock_speed: speed at which microprocessor executes instructions
Dual_sim: Has dual sim support or not
Fc: Front Camera megapixels
Four_g: Has 4G or not
Int_memory: Internal Memory in Gigabytes
M_dep: Mobile Depth in cm
Mobile_wt: Weight of mobile phone
N_cores: Number of cores of processor
Pc: Primary Camera megapixels
Px_height: Pixel Resolution Height
Px_width: Pixel Resolution Width
Ram: Random Access Memory in Megabytes
Sc_h: Screen Height of mobile in cm
Sc_w: Screen Width of mobile in cm
Talk_time: longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are
Three_g: Has 3G or not
Touch_screen: Has touch screen or not
Wifi: Has wifi or not
 
SMART Questions:
Is there any effect on 3G by the factor of 4G?
Is there any effect on Wifi by the factor of Bluetooth?
Is there any relationship between Battery power and the number of cores?
What factors affect the selling price most?
Logistic regression?
